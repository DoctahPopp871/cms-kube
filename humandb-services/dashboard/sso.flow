Prereqs

Enable SSO in Discourse and input our Discourse SSO login API URL (/auth/discourse/sso for example)

1. User goes to Discourse to login and is redirected to our Discourse SSO login API URL (/auth/discourse/sso for example)
2. Our API endpoint validates the request using the payload + signature + SSO secret
3. API endpoint creates temporary non-user specific "Discourse login" token, stores it in database paired with the original Discourse payload + signature, and redirects to our OAuth login page with the temp token as a querystring param
4. Dashboard Login page parses temporary "Discourse login" token and saves it in localStorage
5. User clicks "Log in with google" and is redirected to google
6. User logs in with google and is redirected back to our dashboard/login site
7. User gets token from our API and is now logged in to our Dashboard
8. Dashboard checks localStorage for presence of "Discourse login" temporary token and makes request to API with it
9. API fetches original Disource payload + signature from database with temp token and generates new payload, then redirects user to Discourse SSO login and is now logged into Discourse as well
